## NAME

bluechi-controller.conf - Configuration file to bootstrap bluechi-controller

## DESCRIPTION

The basic file definition used to bootstrap bluechi-controller.

## Format

The bluechi-controller configuration file is using the
[systemd configuration file format](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.syntax.html). Contrary to this, there is no need for the `\` symbol at the end of a line to continue a value on the next line. A value continued on multiple lines will just be concatenated by bluechi. The maximum line length supported is 500 characters. If the value exceeds this limitation, use multiple, indented lines.

Global options for the bluechi controller are contained in the
**[bluechi-controller]** section. In addition, sections named **[node
NODENAME]** allow setting options that are specific to the a
particular node.

## Global options

### **UseTCP** (string)

If this flag is set to `true`, it enables the connection handler for agents to connect
remotely via TCP/IP to the controller. If disabled, all other TCP options such as the
ControllerPort or TCPKeepAliveTime are not used.
The TCP handler can run alongside the handler for local connections (Unix Domain Socket)
as well as the systemd socket activated handler.
Default: true.

### **UseUDS** (string)

If this flag is set to `true`, it enables the connection handler for agents to connect
locally via Unix Domain Socket (UDS) to the controller.
The UDS handler can run alongside the handler for remote connections (TCP/IP) as well as
the systemd socket activated handler.
Default: true.

### **ControllerPort** (uint16_t)

The port the bluechi-controller listens on to establish connections with the `bluechi-agent`. By default port `842` is used.

### **AllowedNodeNames** (string)

A comma separated list of unique bluechi-agent names. Only nodes with
names mentioned in the list, or nodes with **Allowed=true** in a
separate node section can connect to `bluechi-controller`.

These names are defined in the agent's configuration file under `NodeName` option (see `bluechi-agent.conf(5)`).

### **HeartbeatInterval** (long)

The interval to periodically check node's connectivity based on heartbeat signals sent to bluechi, in milliseconds. A value of 0 disables it.

### **NodeHeartbeatThreshold** (long)

The threshold in milliseconds to determine whether a node is disconnected. If the node's last heartbeat signal was received before this threshold, bluechi assumes that the node is down or the connection was cut off and performs a disconnect.

### **LogLevel** (string)

The level used for logging. Supported values are:

- `DEBUG`
- `INFO`
- `WARN`
- `ERROR`

By default `INFO` level is used for logging.

### **LogTarget** (string)

The target where logs are written to. Supported values are:

- `stderr`
- `stderr-full`
- `journald`

By default `journald` is used as the target.

### **LogIsQuiet** (string)

If this flag is set to `true`, no logs are written by bluechi. By default the flag is set to `false`.

### **IPReceiveErrors** (string)

If this flag is set to `true`, it enables extended, reliable error message passing for
the peer connection with all agents. This results in BlueChi receiving errors such as
host unreachable ICMP packets instantly and possibly dropping the connection. This is
useful to detect disconnects faster, but should be used with care as this might cause
unnecessary disconnects in less robut networks.
Default: true.

### **TCPKeepAliveTime** (long)

The number of seconds the individual TCP connection with an agent needs to be idle
before keepalive packets are sent. When `TCPKeepAliveTime` is set to 0, the system
default will be used.
Default: 1s.

### **TCPKeepAliveInterval** (long)

The number of seconds between each keepalive packet. When `TCPKeepAliveInterval` is set to 0,
the system default will be used.
Default: 1s.

### **TCPKeepAliveCount** (long)

The number of keepalive packets without ACK from an agent till the individual connection is dropped.
When `TCPKeepAliveCount` is set to 0, the system default will be used.
Default: 6.

## Per-node options

### **Allowed** (boolean)

If true, the node with the section name is allowed to connect. See **AllowedNodeNames** above.

### **RequiredSelinuxContext** (string)

If set, the connecting node process must have the specified SELinux
type label. Typically for local connections these would be
bluechi_agent_t or haproxy_t.

Note: this option only works when the agent connects using unix domain
sockets.

### **AllowDependenciesOn** (string)

A comma separated list of bluechi-agent names on which the configured
node can request services to be started with the `bluechi-proxy@.service`. 
By default, this list is empty and thus all proxies are denied.

The names are defined in the agent's configuration file under `NodeName` option (see `bluechi-agent.conf(5)`).

## Example

A basic example of a configuration file for `bluechi`:

```
[bluechi-controller]
ControllerPort=842
AllowedNodeNames=agent-007,agent-123
LogLevel=DEBUG
LogTarget=journald
LogIsQuiet=false
```

Example with specific configuration for node `agent-009`:
```
[bluechi-controller]
AllowedNodeNames=agent-007,agent-123

[node agent-009]
Allowed=true
RequiredSelinuxContext=haproxy_t
AllowDependenciesOn=agent-007
```

Example using a value that is continued on multiple lines:

```
[bluechi-controller]
ControllerPort=842
AllowedNodeNames=agent-007,
   agent-123,
   agent-456,
   agent-789
LogLevel=DEBUG
LogTarget=journald
LogIsQuiet=false
```

## FILES

Distributions provide the **/usr/share/bluechi/config/controller.conf** file which defines bluechi configuration defaults. Administrators can copy this file to **/etc/bluechi/controller.conf** and specify their own configuration.

Administrators can also use a "drop-in" directory **/etc/bluechi/controller.conf.d** to drop their configuration changes.
Such drop-ins are especially useful for per-node configuration as they can extend the list of available nodes without
modifying the base configuration file.
