# Eclipse BlueChi&trade;

## Creating a new release

Following actions need to be taken to release a new stable version of BlueChi:

1. Creating and merging a release commit
2. Tagging a release commit
3. Creating and merging a post release commit

### Creating and merging a release commit

Following files need to be updated to create a new stable release commit:

* In [build-scripts/version.sh](./build-scripts/version.sh) set `IS_RELEASE=true`. For the first release of that version
`RELEASE=1` is used. This may be increased if additional package releases are needed.
* CentOS/Fedora: A new `%changelog` section in [bluechi.spec.in](./bluechi.spec.in) should be added and it should
contain information about the new package release
* Debian: A new changelong section in [debian/changelog](./debian/changelog) should be added. It can be as simple
as "Upgrading to vx.x.x"

Here is the example of the release commit for version
[0.6.0](https://github.com/eclipse-bluechi/bluechi/pull/637).

### Tagging a release commit

When the release commit is merged, we need to tag the release commit to be able to create an official release visible
on the GitHub [project pages](https://github.com/eclipse-bluechi/bluechi/releases).

The tag should use `v<VERSION>` format, where `<VERSION>` is the version of the release we want to create (for example
the tag should be `v0.1.0` for the 0.1.0 version). There are 2 ways to create a release tag:

* Using GitHub web UI, when creating a release (see following section)
* Using standard git commands
  1. Create a release tag pointing to the release commit:

     ```shell
     git tag v<VERSION> <GIT HASH>
     ```

     where `v<VERSION` is the release tag and `<GIT HASH>` is the git has of the relevant release commit.
  2. Push the commit to the repo:

     ``` shell
     git push origin v<VERSION>
     ```

     where `v<VERSION>` is the new release tag.

**WARNING**: If a release tag has a different format, source archive for the release will have a different structure,
which would cause RPM build for Fedora to fail.

Pushing the new tag to the repository will trigger a [GitHub workflow](./.github/workflows/publish.yml) which
automatically creates a new release. It will be listed on the
[release page](https://github.com/eclipse-bluechi/bluechi/releases) of BlueChi. Assets such as the .src.rpm are
generated and added to that release by the workflow. In addition to the generated release notes, its good to manually
add a **Highlights** section describing the most important changes.

### Creating and merging a post release commit

Following files need to be updated to switch the build from release build back to snapshot build. In [build-scripts/version.sh](./build-scripts/version.sh)

* set `IS_RELEASE=false`
* increase the project version `VERSION`

Here is the example of the post release commit for version
[0.6.0](https://github.com/eclipse-bluechi/bluechi/pull/639).

**WARNING:** There should not be merged any commits to the project between the release commit and the post release
commit to make things clear.

### Creating the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

After the new release has been created, the [GitHub workflow for generating BlueChi's SBOMs](./.github/workflows/sbom.yml)
can be started manually (by project collaborators) for the recent tag created. It uses [sbom4rpms](https://github.com/engelmi/sbom4rpm)
and will build as well as analyze BlueChi's runtime dependencies declared in the RPM packages recursively. The
generated SBOMs are being attached to the Action run.
The .zip containing the SBOMs can be downloaded and attached to the assets of the respective BlueChi release.

## Creating a PyPi release for BlueChi bindings

The release of the BlueChi API bindings to PyPi is part of the [release pipeline](./.github/workflows/publish.yml).
However, if the job for creating the PyPi release fails, this can also be done manually.

1. Checkout the created tag

```bash
git checkout v1.1.0
```

2. Generate the bindings and verify there are **no changes**

```bash
$ ./build-scripts/generate-bindings.sh python
...
$ git diff
<no diff>
```

3. Build the python wheel

```bash
# Prerequisite: Install necessary python packages
$ pip install -r src/bindings/python/requirements-packager.txt
...
# Build the python package
$ ./build-scripts/build-bindings.sh python
```

4. Upload the python package via [twine](https://pypi.org/project/twine/)

```bash
# Optional: Upload to test pypi first to verify everything works as expected
$ twine upload -r testpypi src/bindings/python/dist/*
...
$ twine upload -r pypi src/bindings/python/dist/*
...
```
